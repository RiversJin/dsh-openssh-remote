// Regression: a machine-scoped picker commit must not land on a machine that
// another actor switched to while the picker was open.
//
// The workspace picker acts on the shared ACTIVE pool but remembers its own
// `machineId`. Before PR #42 it re-posted /current before every /ls, which
// incidentally kept the active pool pinned to the picker's machine; the
// per-keystroke reconnect fix (issue #41) removed that accident. With the
// client cache a cache-hit re-type issues NO host request at all, so nothing
// re-applied the picker's machine before its commit — and /mirror carried no
// identity, so it used whatever machine happened to be active. Reproduced
// against a real host: the picker displayed machine A's tree and the mirror was
// created with machine B's identity.
//
// The contract: /mirror (and /home) accept an optional `machineId` naming the
// machine the caller is showing, and the host re-asserts it before acting.
//   • named machine → re-applied (the commit lands on the intended identity)
//   • unknown id    → refused (404), never a silent fall back to the active one
//   • absent id     → unchanged machine-scoped behaviour (active pool)
//
// The route ordering is what makes this testable without SSH: the identity
// re-assertion happens BEFORE the directory probe, so a failing probe still
// proves which machine the request was bound to.
