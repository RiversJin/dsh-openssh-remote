/**
 * Reject a browser-shaped request that is not same-origin ours.
 *
 * This is the FALLBACK fence, used only when the Connection service (which owns
 * DSH's authoritative `requestRejection`) is absent — an old composition that
 * has a `webServer` but no browser-authentication owner. It is deliberately
 * fail-closed on the three browser vectors our own routes would otherwise
 * accept:
 *   • `sec-fetch-site: cross-site` — a page on any origin driving our API;
 *   • an `Origin` that is not our own authority — the same, with CORS markers;
 *   • a non-loopback `Host` — DNS rebinding, where a name the attacker controls
 *     resolves to 127.0.0.1 so even `Origin === Host` looks "same-origin".
 * Non-browser callers (curl, scripts) carry no `Sec-Fetch-*`/`Origin` and a
 * loopback `Host`, so they keep working; that is the same shape DSH's own fence
 * implements for `/api`.
 *
 * A request with no HTTP headers at all is not a browser request — it comes
 * from an in-process caller (tests, and the Desktop carrier's IPC path, which
 * authenticates before dispatch) — so there is no browser layer to defend.
 *
 * @param {import('node:http').IncomingMessage} req - the request under test.
 * @returns {number|undefined} 403 to reject, undefined to proceed.

/**
 * Wrap one route so every request passes DSH's browser trust fence first.
 *
 * The legacy `/dsh-remote/*` routes are registered straight on `webServer`, which
 * applies no Host/Origin check and no browser authentication — `requestRejection`
 * lives on the Connection service and is only wired to `/api` and the
 * `/api/remote.mux` upgrade. Without this wrapper our mutating routes were
 * reachable cross-site as "simple requests" (no preflight: a `text/plain` POST
 * needs no CORS approval), so any page the user visited could define a tunnel,
 * rewrite the machine registry, or drive `update-apply`. The model tools were
 * never exposed that way; only these JSON routes were.
 *
 * The lookup is deferred to request time because `webServer` and `connection`
 * arrive independently: the fence must engage as soon as authentication exists,
 * and must not be baked in from whichever service happened to be present when
 * the route was registered.
 *
 * @param {object} route - a webServer route definition.
 * @param {() => object|undefined} connectionOf - resolves the live Connection service.
 * @returns {object} a route whose handler enforces the fence before dispatching.
